# Compiling the C Library

## Creating the .h and the .so files:


```go build -o lib_udsclient.so -buildmode=c-shared cclient.go```
	- this creates .h and .so files from the cclient.go file.


## Creating the .h and the .a files:

```go build -o lib_udsclient.a -buildmode=c-archive ./cclient.go```
	- this creates .h and .a files



## Usage

After creating the .h and/or the .a and the .o files as described in the previous steps,
this is how to use the functions generated by cgo

``` char* GetUdsClientVersion()```
This returns the version of our handshake on your local machine/client.

```char* GetUdsServerVersion()```
This returns the version of our handshake on the server/host.

```int RequestXskMapFd(char* device)```
This requests an Xsk map Fd for a specifed device.

```int RequestBusyPoll(int busyTimeout, int busyBudget, int fd)```
This requests a busy poll for a specific device by using it's fd, and specifying a timeout and a budget.

```void CleanUpConnection()```
After all the other functions are called, this needs to be called after all the work you need to do is done,
so that the connection to the Uds can be cleaned up.
